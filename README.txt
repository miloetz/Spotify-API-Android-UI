Welcome to our Spotify API application.

This project is in its early stages and aims to provide a seamless interface for accessing Spotify's features through the Spotify API. Currently, we're focusing on implementing the login page functionality to retrieve the users data, which will serve as the gateway to accessing the application's main features.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Login Page:

Upon launching the application, you'll be directed to the login page where you can securely authenticate your Spotify account. Once logged in successfully, you'll gain access to the following tabs:

Currently Playing: Get real-time updates on the currently playing song, whether it's your own playlist or a friend's.

Search: Search for songs, artists, albums, or playlists to discover new music or find old favorites.

Charts: Explore trending tracks and playlists from around the globe or specific regions.

Settings: Customize your experience with playback settings, notification preferences, and more.
